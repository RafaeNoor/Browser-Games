### Floor is Lava ###

The classic game of imagining the floor is lava, and staying off the ground for as long as possible. The game is implemented using javascript and html5 canvas, which is supported by  most modern day browsers. No other dependencies are involved, hence it is relatively light weight.

Every ~5 seconds, new obstacles are generated and the player must remain on these platforms to keep increasing the score. Once the player touches the ground the score is reset to 0, and a high score is recorded. 

By using the Arrow keys to move, the player is incentivised to remain at the lower platforms, as the higher you go, the rate at which the score increases is slower. Also the height of the jump at higher platforms is reduced, so even though it may be safer, any jumps on higher levels are riskier. 

Note:=
This game was made as a means of learning the basics of programming games in JS. Clearly the code is very messy, primarily to identify the basic concepts required.
