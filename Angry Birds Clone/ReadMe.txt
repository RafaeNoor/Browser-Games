Work in progress of an angry birds clone. Assets were made using Gimp. To play, hold the mouse's left key, and position the bird sprite. Then relative to the center of the slingshots center (A white square is drawn for ease of visualisation), the bird will be launched. When the bird comes into contact with any of the pigs, they disappear.
